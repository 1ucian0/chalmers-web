class PublicationSource(str, Enum):
    '''
    Defines the source of the publication. In general, a publication 
    on Google Scholar has two forms:
    * Appearing as a PUBLICATION SNIPPET and
    * Appearing as a paper in an AUTHOR PAGE
    
    ------------
    
    "PUBLICATION SEARCH SNIPPET". 
    This form captures the publication  when it appears as a "snippet" in 
    the context of the resuls of a publication search. For example:
    
    Publication search: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=adaptive+fraud+detection&btnG=&as_sdt=0%2C33
    
    The entries appear under the <div class = "gs_r gs_or gs_scl"> tags
    Each entry has a data-cid attribute (e.g., data-cid="pthm1bWT96oJ")
    
    The same type of results will also appear when someome searches 
    using the "cited by", "related articles", and "all XX versions" links
    that appear under the publication snippet.
    
    "Cited By" link: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12319477714873931942&as_sdt=5,33&sciodt=0,33&hl=en
    
    "Related Articles" link: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:pthm1bWT96oJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=adaptive+fraud+detection&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33
    
    "All versions" link: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12319477714873931942&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33
    
    The snippet version of these publications contain the information that appears in the results.
    Often, the snippet version will miss authors, will have an abbreviated name for the venue, and so on.
    
    We can fill these snippets by clicking on the "Cite" button" and get back the MLA/APA/Chicago/... 
    citations forms, PLUS links for BibTeX, EndNote, RefMan, and RefWorks.
    
    ------------
    "AUTHOR PUBLICATION ENTRY"
    
    We also have publications that appear in the "author pages" of Google Scholar. 
    These publications are often a set of publications "merged" together. 
    
    The snippet version of these publications conains the title of the publication,
    a subset of the authors, the (sometimes truncated) venue, and the year of the publication
    and the number of papers that cite the publication.
    
    The snippet entries appear under the <tr class="gsc_a_tr"> entries in the main page of the author.
    
    To fill in the publication, we open the "detailed view" of the paper
