# scholarly

scholarly is a module that allows you to retrieve author and publication information from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) in a friendly, Pythonic way.

## Important Note

This is version 1.3 of the `scholarly` library. There has been a major refactor in the way the library operates and it's code structure and it **will break** most existing code, based on the previous (v0.x) versions.
