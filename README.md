# scholarly
scholarly is a module that allows you to retrieve author and publication information from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) in a friendly, Pythonic way.

## Documentation

Check the [documentation](https://scholarly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for a complete reference. (Warning: Still under development, please excuse the messiness.)

## Installation
Use `pip` to install from pypi:

```bash
pip3 install scholarly
```

or `pip` to install from github:

```bash
pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/OrganicIrradiation/scholarly.git
```


## Usage
Because `scholarly` does not use an official API, no key is required. Simply:

```python
from scholarly import scholarly

print(next(scholarly.search_author('Steven A. Cholewiak')))
```

### Example
Here's a quick example demonstrating how to retrieve an author's profile then retrieve the titles of the papers that cite his most popular (cited) paper.

```python
from scholarly import scholarly

# Retrieve the author's data, fill-in, and print
search_query = scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak')
author = next(search_query).fill()
print(author)

# Print the titles of the author's publications
print([pub.bib['title'] for pub in author.publications])

# Take a closer look at the first publication
pub = author.publications[0].fill()
print(pub)

# Which papers cited that publication?
print([citation.bib['title'] for citation in pub.get_citedby()])
```

## Methods for `scholar`

{'bib': {'abstract': 'Humans can judge from vision alone whether an object is '
                     'physically stable or not. Such judgments allow observers '

                     'to guide their motor actions. We investigated the visual '

                     '(COM). In Experiment 1, observers viewed an object near '

```

### Methods for `Publication` objects

#### `fill`

By default, scholarly returns only a lightly filled object for publication, to avoid overloading Google Scholar. 
If necessary to get more information for the publication object, we call the `.fill()` method.

#### `get_citedby`

Searches GScholar for other articles that cite this Publication and returns a Publication generator.

#### `bibtex`

 You can export a publication to Bibtex by using the `bibtex` property.
Here's a quick example:

```python
>>> query = scholarly.search_pubs("A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise")
>>> pub = next(query)
>>> pub.bibtex
```

by running the code above you should get the following bibtext entry:

```bib
@inproceedings{ester1996density,
 abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input},
 author = {Ester, Martin and Kriegel, Hans-Peter and Sander, J{\"o}rg and Xu, Xiaowei},
 booktitle = {Kdd},
 cites = {17500},
 eprint = {https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------},
 gsrank = {1},
 number = {34},
 pages = {226--231},
 title = {A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise.},
 url = {https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------},
 venue = {Kdd},
 volume = {96},
 year = {1996}
}
```

### Methods for `Author` objects

#### `Author.fill(sections=[])` -- Populate the Author object with information from their profile. 

The optional `sections` parameter takes a
  list of the portions of author information to fill, as follows:
  - `'basics'` = name, affiliation, and interests;
  - `'indices'` = h-index, i10-index, and 5-year analogues;
  - `'counts'` = number of citations per year;
  - `'coauthors'` = co-authors;
  - `'publications'` = publications;
  - `'[]'` = all of the above (this is the default)

```python
>>> search_query = scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak')
>>> author = next(search_query)
>>> print(author.fill(sections=['basics', 'indices', 'coauthors']))
{'affiliation': 'Vision Scientist',
 'citedby': 262,
 'citedby5y': 186,
 'coauthors': [{'affiliation': 'Kurt Koffka Professor of Experimental Psychology, University '

## Using proxies

In general, Google Scholar does not like bots, and can often block scholarly. We are actively
working towards making scholarly more robust towards that front.

The most common solution for avoiding network issues is to use proxies and Tor. 

The following options are available:

#### `scholarly.use_proxy`

Here is an example using the [FreeProxy](https://pypi.org/project/free-proxy/) library

```python
from fp.fp import FreeProxy
from scholarly import scholarly

proxy = FreeProxy(rand=True, timeout=1, country_id=['US', 'CA']).get()  
scholarly.use_proxy(http=proxy, https=proxy)

author = next(scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak'))
print(author)
```

Or, if you have a Tor proxy available (say, running at port `9050` locally), then

```python
from scholarly import scholarly

proxy = 'socks5://127.0.0.1:9050'
scholarly.use_proxy(http=proxy, https=proxy)

author = next(scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak'))
print(author)
```

#### `scholarly.use_tor()`


This option assumes that you have access to a Tor server and a `torrc` file configuring the Tor server
to have a control port configured with a password; this setup allows scholarly to refresh the Tor ID, 
if scholarly runs into problems accessing Google Scholar. 

If you want to install and use Tor, then instal it using the command 
```
sudo apt-get install -y tor
```
See [setup_tor.sh](https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly/blob/master/setup_tor.sh) 
on how to setup a minimal, working `torrc` and set the password for the control server. (Note:
the script uses `scholarly_password` as the default password, but you may want to change it for your 
installation.)


```python
from scholarly import scholarly

scholarly.use_tor(tor_sock_port=9050, tor_control_port=9051, tor_password="scholarly_password")

author = next(scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak'))
print(author)
```

#### `scholarly.launch_tor()`

If you have Tor installed locally, this option allows scholarly to launch its own Tor process.
You need to pass a pointer to the Tor executable in your syste,

```python
from scholarly import scholarly

scholarly.launch_tor('/usr/bin/tor')

author = next(scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak'))
print(author)
```



## Tests

To run tests execute the `test_module.py` file as:

```bash
python3 test_module
```

or
```bash
python3 -m unittest -v test_module.py
```

## Build Docs

To build the documentation execute the make file as:

```bash
make html
```
